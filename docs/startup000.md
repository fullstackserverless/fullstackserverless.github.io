> Replace your five ✋🏻 developers with one ☝🏻

If you are building your digital startup, then most likely your team is consist of these developers:

- iOS developer 📱,
- Android developer📱,
- Backend developer💻,
- Website Developer 🖥 and
- teamlead🧙‍♂️, who at least superficially understands a little bit everywhere, but there are 5 people on the team.

Nowadays, thanks to AWS Amplify (Amazon) technologies, you can replace those 5 people
with one full stack serverless developer.
We provide opportunity to YOU to find such a full stack serverless developer for only \$99
using our application

Why Choose Us ?
Because we are the creators of the first Runet course on React Native and AWS Amplify.
Developers are learning this technology based on our course and we personally know successful students
with whom we are creating our mobile application.

> Full Stack Serverless is an open-source step by step guide to building full-stack
> serverless applications using React Native + AWS Amplify + GraphQL..

## 3. Motivate to solve problems

For successfully provided technical support, developers will be given a unicorn, which will
be used to form the developer's rating. This increases their chances of receiving more job offers from employers.

## 4. Teach React Native + GraphQL + AWS Amplify Tech Stack

Based on the code written for this application a Full-Stack Serverless training course is being
created using one of the progressive tech stacks, React Native + AWS Amplify + GraphQL.

## Current AWS Amplify Feature Set:

📦 Easy CI CD / hosting / custom domains

🛢 Serverless DBs & functions

🤖 ML & AI

📱 GraphQL

📊 Analytics

💻 Offline & RT

📣 Chat

# Workflow

The practice is enough for any levels, from creation components to custom hooks.
The workflow is carried out based on the Kanban methodology. The board is available here.[here](https://github.com/react-native-village/aws-amplify-react-hooks/projects/1).

## Tasks are divided into three types:

- UI - creating layout components

- Screens & Navigation - composition of screens from UI components

- Logic - business logic

Choose a task for yourself from the backlog column and coordinate it with me on our [chat](https://discord.gg/Ntuttww) or suggest your task.

Application design is available on [Sketch](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixqgri05i2mtu6p/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9.sketch?dl=0)
